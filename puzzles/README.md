# Puzzles

## Assignment

This assignment contains two puzzles: `assignment1` and `assignment2`. Each one has instructions and a single function that you must implement (feel free to define helper functions). There are also tests in the `tests` directory which you can run by running `bun test` in the `puzzles` directory.

## Definition of "Done"

The code is clean and compiles, the tests pass. When you're happy with that, move onto the next assignment.

## Study Guide

### I struggled with assignment 1
You need to rehearse Typescript syntax and the fundamentals of programming.

 - You should redo relevant portions of the [precourse](https://github.com/fractal-bootcamp/precourse-materials?tab=readme-ov-file)
 - You will find [Typescript basics](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/typescript-basics) useful
 - some intro programming puzzles (e.g. on Scrimba) helpful. Focus on writing simple, clean programs you understand.
 - Make sure you know how to use arrays, objects, map, filter, if/else, while, for, etc.

### I struggled with assignment 2
You need to practice more with data modelling, program decomposition, and mental simulation of problems.

 - The early days of any year of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) are great
 - 5+ kyu problems on [Codewars Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57121e6fcdbf63eb94000e51)
 - Focus on understanding the problem and solving it in your head first, then write pseudocode, then write real code.
