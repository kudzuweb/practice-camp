/**
 * Problem: Find Peak Indices
 *
 * Context:
 * Given an array of integers, return the indices of positions that are strict
 * local maxima relative to their immediate neighbors. Index i is a peak if
 * i-1 and i+1 exist and nums[i] > nums[i-1] and nums[i] > nums[i+1].
 * Do not consider edges as peaks. Plateaus (equal neighbors) are not peaks.
 *
 * Input:
 * - nums: number[]
 *
 * Output:
 * - number[] of indices in ascending order
 *
 * Examples:
 * - [1,2,1,9,4,6,4] -> [1,3,5]
 * - [3,3,3] -> []
